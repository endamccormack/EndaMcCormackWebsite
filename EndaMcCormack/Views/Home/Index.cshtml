                                <p>My name is Enda Mc Cormack, I come from a small town in Ireland called Riverstown, County Sligo, 
                                   which is on the west coast for those who don't know,<a class="nonJsLink" href="/Content/Images/endamccormack/me/2c8058a.jpg"

                                   it is the most beautiful place in Ireland in my view and I always miss it when I leave. I come 
                                   from humble beginnings and was brought up with a mentality for the importance a hard day's work.
                                   I've been described as proactive, ambitious, creative, learn quickly, flexible, smart and a good 
                                   leader.

                                <p>
                                As for me, I am a tech mad uber nerd. Most of my interests revolve around tech, most of which is computing. My main interests in tech 
                                is the web and software engineering, that being said I am rather varied, I try to be flexible and be an all in one developer, I jump 
                                from programming to graphics design, to web, to layouts, to computer hardware and systems, and databases. My main interests at the moment 
                                is certainly the web, its growing to be so dynamic and with the development of HTML5 and JavaScript whatever you can build for an operating 
                                system you can now build for the web and easily have to truly cross platform project without sacrificing much of the powerful things you can do natively.
                                </p>

                        <h3>SKILLS</h3>
                        So some of the technologies I know, this can be a difficult list to compile because as I learn so many different things I know some things 
                        about a lot of languages and only specialize in a small handful. Short list of my best for each supported platform which I think represents 
                        me pretty well would be: (Roll over to see more details)
